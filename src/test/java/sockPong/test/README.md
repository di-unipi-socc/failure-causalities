# Testing Classes

### Testing based on Example Log Files
The runnable classes in the sub-folder `classicTest` enable visualising the output obtained by analysing the 
[example log files](https://github.com/di-unipi-socc/failure-causalities/tree/main/data/examples/sockPongLog) with `WhyAlgorithm.why`.
To make the class-to-log file mapping explicit, the Java classes have been assigned the same name as the log files.

### Chaos Testing
The runnable class `ChaosTest` enables visualising the output of the 30 [log files](https://github.com/di-unipi-socc/failure-causalities/tree/main/data/examples/chaosTesting/chaosLog) obtained by executing the [Python script](https://github.com/di-unipi-socc/failure-causalities/blob/main/data/examples/chaosTesting/monkey/chaos.py) for chaos testing.
